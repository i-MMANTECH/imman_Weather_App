# imman_Weather_App
A simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to fetch and display weather data from an API, providing real-time weather information in a user-friendly interface. Explore the code to see how HTML structures the layout, CSS styles the design, and JavaScript handles the data retrieval and dynamic updates.

### Overview
This repository contains a weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to view current weather conditions based on their location or a searched city. It fetches data from a weather API and updates the interface dynamically.

### Features
- Display current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- Support for searching weather information by city name.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the application.

3. **API Integration**
   - Sign up for a free API key from a weather service provider which is the OpenWeatherMap.
   - Replace the placeholder in `script.js` with your API key:
     ```javascript
     const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
     ```

4. **Understand the Code Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the app.
   - `styles.css`: Defines the styles and layout of the app.
   - `script.js`: Handles API calls, data processing, and DOM manipulation.

5. **Run the App**
   - The app does not require any server-side setup. Open `index.html` directly in a browser to start using the app.

### How It Works
1. **User Input**
   - Users can enter a city name into the search field and press the search button.

2. **API Request**
   - JavaScript sends a request to the weather API using the entered city name or the user’s geolocation.

3. **Data Processing**
   - The app processes the API response and extracts relevant weather information.

4. **UI Update**
   - JavaScript updates the HTML with the current weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

### Customization
- **Styling**: Modify `styles.css` to change the app’s appearance.
- **Functionality**: Enhance `script.js` to add more features, such as a forecast view or additional weather details.
